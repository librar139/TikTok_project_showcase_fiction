TikTok project proposal
TikTok seeks a way to use machine learning to extract claims or propositions within TikTok videos
and comments and classify each data point as a claim or opinion.

Backgroud: We have a story that tiktok videos needed to be reviewed by moderators. But there are a large number of user reports generated daily. So, development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. It's very important to identify videos that break the terms of service. The worst case for a claim that's misclassified as an opinion is that the video does not get reviewed and it violates the terms of service. So it's more important to minimize false negatives. By using the PACE workflow combined with EDA process to evaluate each stages. The project started from 0 to 1.
Purpose: Successful built the predictive model (machine learning).
Outcome: (dails in other notebooks.)
