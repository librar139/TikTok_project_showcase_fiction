# Display first few rows
data.head()
# Generate a table of descriptive statistics about the data
data.describe()
# Check for missing values
data.isna().sum()
# Drop rows with missing values
data = data.dropna(axis=0)
# Display first few rows after handling missing values
data.head()
data.isna().sum()
# Compute the mean `video_view_count` for each group in `verified_status`
data.groupby('verified_status')['video_view_count'].mean()
